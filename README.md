So you can compile the 3 flavors... 
1 both, like GitHub, 
2 control + f (true and change the wave  value to false = no wave)
3 . Control + f ( same ... True for wave false the other one) then control + f (180 ...change the 180/256 value) compile... 
Thats It. Im working on the FILE FOLDER stuff. But same for the MP3 player (now beta M5Burner) (⁠⌐⁠■⁠-⁠■⁠)
So this github file are a base Code for 3 flavors. If you need change colors C+F (CONTROL +F) 0x so you find de 0x****** (*=rrggbb i mean 0xFF00FF neón Pink) you can change any colour line! (⁠✿⁠☉⁠｡⁠☉⁠)
c++ stuff here
The rest of Code its a LITTLE more complex But if you Play With It you can LEARN a lot.  The station must be IceCast mp3 Up to 192kbps 
The beeps sound are like 1000 / 100 Code format
1000 duration / 100 tone  so C+F (control + f) tone to find line that too. (⁠＾⁠∇⁠＾⁠)⁠ﾉ⁠♪

I mean Line of Code.. 
@ Arduino the keyboard shortcut control + F (find shorcut) so... 180 send you to the line With the 180/256 value... Maybe i leave coments there...
 Hope that helps. Excuse my por english too. 乁⁠༼⁠☯⁠‿⁠☯⁠✿⁠༽⁠ㄏ
